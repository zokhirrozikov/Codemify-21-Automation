// Challenge 6: Season Checker
// Write a function called checkSeason that takes a month as an argument (from 1-12 where 1 is January and 12 is December) 
// and checks which season it is based on meteorological seasons. The function should return "Winter" for December (12), 
// January (1), and February (2), "Spring" for March (3), April (4), and May (5), "Summer" for June (6), July (7), 
// and August (8), and "Autumn" for September (9), October (10), and November (11).
// Usage examples:
function checkSeason(month) {
    if (month < 1 || month > 12) {
        return "Invalid month";
    } if (month >= 12 || month <= 2) {
        return "Winter";
    } else if (month >= 3 && month <=5) {
        return "Spring";
    } else if (month >= 6 && month <= 8) {
        return "Summer";
    } else {
        return "Fall";
    }
}
console.log(checkSeason(1)); // "Winter"
console.log(checkSeason(4)); // "Spring"
console.log(checkSeason(7)); // "Summer"
console.log(checkSeason(10)); // "Autumn"
