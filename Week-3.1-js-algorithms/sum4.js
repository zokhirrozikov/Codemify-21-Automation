// Challenge 4: Multi-level conditions II
// Write a function called checkEligibility that accepts an age and returns whether the person is eligible to vote, 
// drive, and/or drink. If the person is 16 or older, they can drive. If they are 18 or older, they can vote. 
// If they are 21 or older, they can drink.
// Usage examples:
function checkEligibility(age) {
    let eligibility = [];
    if (age >= 16) {
        eligibility.push("drive");
    }
    if (age >= 18) {
        eligibility.push("vote");
    }
    if (age >= 21) {
        eligibility.push("drink");
    } 
    if (eligibility.length === 0) {
        return "Can't vote, drive or drink";
    } else  {
        return "Can " + eligibility.join(" and ");
    }
}
console.log(checkEligibility(15)); // "Can't vote, drive, or drink"
console.log(checkEligibility(16)); // "Can drive"
console.log(checkEligibility(18)); // "Can vote and drive"
console.log(checkEligibility(22)); // "Can vote, drive, and drink"
